	abstract = {Classifying trip modalities, i.e. driving, walking, etc., from GPS trajectories is one of the fundamental tasks for urban mobility analytics. It can be used for efficient route planning, human activity recognition, and public transportation design where understanding the time and location of transitioning to different modalities may provide additional insights. Informally, given a GPS trajectory consisting of temporally ordered GPS locations, trip modality/activity classification aims to assign trip modes to each GPS point. It is a challenging task due to the associated noise with the GPS data, the lack of knowledge about the underlying road network as well as the driving traffic conditions which may affect the trip behavior (e.g. driving slower than walking speed at rush hour traffic). Despite its widespread applications, the existing methods are either dependent on multi-sensor data (such as GPS, IMU, Camera, etc.) or use heuristic-based filtering to classify modalities of the trajectory datasets. Moreover, they consider limited number of transitions per trip making them inadequate for more frequent activity changes. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network architecture, Frequent Activity Classification Network FACNet, leveraging a bi-directional LSTM network and a custom Attention module to infer modality of GPS points in a trajectory with frequent modality changes. Our supervised learning approach depends only on the GPS trace without any additional inputs, making it applicable to a wide variety of modality related problems. Experiments confirm the superiority of our method compared to the related work as well as heuristic approaches. Finally, we provide access to a set of anonymized GPS trajectories that is made available to the broader research community to provide opportunities to further improve the existing research on the topic.},

	abstract = {Embedding models have been recognized as an effective learning paradigm for high-dimensional data. However, a major embedding model training obstacle is that updating and retrieving the shared large-scale embedding parameters usually dominates the distributed training cycle, leading to significant scalability issues. This paper presents HET-GMP, a distributed system on training embedding models. Uniquely, HET-GMP takes advantage of a graph-based approach to efficiently increase scalability. The key insight guiding our design is the "graph way of thinking". HET-GMP creates a bigraph abstraction to represent the access relationships between data samples and embedding vectors. This enables HET-GMP to embrace graph locality and skewness as new performance opportunities and to exploit graph-based replication/partitioning and bounded-asynchronous synchronization to reduce communication overhead. We evaluate the system on the embedding models for click-through rate (CTR) prediction, which presents the most significant challenge and communication bottleneck due to heavy access concurrency to a huge embedding table. The result shows that HET-GMP supports embedding model training with 1011 parameters, achieving a reduction in communication up to 87.5\% and an up-to 27.5x speedup over the state-of-the-art baseline systems.},

Solid waste management is a chain of many factors which include proper garbage picking, organized transport, trained staff, proper channel of garbage disposition, a fully automated tracking system, and awareness in the general public about the do's and don'ts. It is equally important as any other system of survival in a city like Karachi. This paper deals with, how GIS (Geographic Information System) can be used as a decision support tool for planning waste management Total amount of waste generated in Karachi is more than 9000 tons and land filling is the most acceptable solution for waste disposal. However an inappropriate selected site can lead to many environmental, economical and ecological impacts. For the selection of landfill or final disposal site of waste many factors were kept in consideration. The aim of this paper is to select an appropriate site for the landfill or final waste disposal site of waste for District Korangi, Karachi. Many factors were kept under consideration like water bodies, road distance and land use. The designed models have been implemented on the data obtained from the satellite images for the analysis in ARCGIS software. Weighted overlay analysis, a decision making tool was used for the selection of suitable site. The results suggest some modification in the existing system which is expected to reduce the waste management workload to a certain extent.},

This technique does not rely on sequential GPS traces to learn network topology, unlike other approaches. Tuning several hyper-parameters can adjust this process for datasets and networks with unique characteristics. Reconstruction and adaption are also possible based on newly acquired data sources. Constructed trail maps, trained on publicly available GPS data, are compared against a ground truth map from Open Street Map (OSM). Performance is evaluated based on completeness, accuracy, and topological correctness. Testing on sparse networks with minimal GPS noise suggests favorable performance.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the emissions of the three most sold categories of light vehicles: sedans, SUVs, and pickups. The research is carried out through an innovative methodology based on GPS and machine learning in real driving conditions. For this purpose, driving data from the three best-selling vehicles in Ecuador are acquired using a data logger with GPS included, and emissions are measured using a PEMS in six RDE tests with two standardized routes for each vehicle. The data obtained on Route 1 are used to estimate the gears used during driving using the K-means algorithm and classification trees. Then, the relative importance of driving variables is estimated using random forest techniques, followed by the training of ANNs to estimate CO2, CO, NOX, and HC. The data generated on Route 2 are used to validate the obtained ANNs. These models are fed with a dataset generated from 324, 300, and 316 km of random driving for each type of vehicle. The results of the model were compared with the IVE model and an OBD-based model, showing similar results without the need to mount the PEMS on the vehicles for long test drives. The generated model is robust to different traffic conditions as a result of its training and validation using a large amount of data obtained under completely random driving conditions.},

However, the GPS signal is easily affected by environmental factors, which makes the quality of the original data uneven and affects the use effect. This research suggests an isolation forest-based technique for detecting GPS anomaly data. The isolated tree set is first created using the subsamples from the training set, and the samples are then added to the isolated tree to get the anomaly score for each sample point. The obtained aberrant scores are then examined to provide abnormal information. In the experiment, actual GPS data from sanitation vehicles is used, and the LOF local anomaly factor technique is chosen for cross-validation. The outcomes demonstrate that the technique can accurately and successfully identify anomalous GPS data.},

	abstract = {This study introduces an innovative algorithm for classifying transportation modes. It categorizes modes such as walking, biking, tram, bus, taxi, and private vehicles based on data collected through sensors embedded in smartphones. The data include date, time, latitude, longitude, altitude, and speed, gathered using a mobile application specifically designed for this project. These data were collected through the smartphone’s GPS to enhance the accuracy of the analysis. The stopping times of each transport mode, as well as the distance traveled and average speed, are analyzed to identify patterns and distinctive features. Conducted in Cuenca, Ecuador, the study aims to develop and validate an algorithm to enhance urban planning. It extracts significant features from mobility patterns, including speed, acceleration, and over-acceleration, and applies longitudinal dynamics to train the classification model. The classification algorithm relies on a decision tree model, achieving a high accuracy of 94.6\% in validation and 94.9\% in testing, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Additionally, the precision metric of 0.8938 signifies the model’s ability to make correct positive predictions, with nearly 90\% of positive instances correctly identified. Furthermore, the recall metric at 0.83084 highlights the model’s capability to identify real positive instances within the dataset, capturing over 80\% of positive instances. The calculated F1-score of 0.86117 indicates a harmonious balance between precision and recall, showcasing the models robust and well-rounded performance in classifying transport modes effectively. The study discusses the potential applications of this method in urban planning, transport management, public transport route optimization, and urban traffic monitoring. This research represents a preliminary stage in generating an origin–destination (OD) matrix to better understand how people move within the city.},
